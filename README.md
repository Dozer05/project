# project
This is my knowledge on coding. 99% of it is straight from Brackeys videos. The project is largely unfinished. I work on it from time to time.
Everything is on Visual Studios for Unity, but a quick Google search say Visual Stuidos and C++ are pretty similar, so I am confindent that this information can be carried over to C++
There is currently a massive bug, where if I shoot foward in a 90 degree cone, the dubug (and in turn, raycast) will say that I am currently shooting myself. I am unsure of how to fix this
